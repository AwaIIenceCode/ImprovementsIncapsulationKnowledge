## Pet Manager
A simple C# console app to manage pet info using a Pet class. Perfect for practicing OOP basics like constructors and encapsulation.

## 📖 About
Pet Manager lets you:
- Create pets with name, age, type, and fed status.
- Show pet details in a clean console output.
- Feed pets to toggle their fed status.
- Built to get comfy with OOP in C#, focusing on constructor overloading, input checks, and clean method design.

## 🚀 Features
- Pet Creation: Initialize pets with flexible constructors (name only, name + age, or full details).
- Input Checks: Validates name, type (non-empty), and age (1–20).
- Display Info: Prints pet name, type, age, and fed status with Print.
- Feed Action: Updates fed status with a confirmation message.
- Encapsulation: Private fields keep data safe and tidy.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- Create Pet objects with different constructor options.
- Call Print to see pet details.
- Use Feed to mark a pet as fed and check the update.
- Console shows pet info before and after feeding.

## 📋 Example Usage
Pet - Name: Rio, Type: Unknown, Age: 1, Fed: No

Pet - Name: Lapochka, Type: Unknown, Age: 9, Fed: No

Pet - Name: Vesta, Type: dog, Age: 9, Fed: No

I feed pet...

Cool! Pet fed

Pet - Name: Vesta, Type: dog, Age: 9, Fed: Yes
